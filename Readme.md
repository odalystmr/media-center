# Media Center


This application is a media center. You can view a catalog of different items (Films, series, books and videogames).
Also, you can add new items and search in the catalog using the title or author.

At the beginning, the application will show a menu with those different options.
You must press a number to choose the option. 

When you create a new item you can not create an item with the same title that already exist if they are in the same type of item.

In `Main` there are default pre-created data as an example.

You need to have installed `JDK Temorium-17`  to run this program.
